# Who am I ?

I currently work as a **DFIR Analyst** at [Safercy](https://safercy.com). I enjoy playing **CTFs**, I've played for **MindBreakers** (ESGI team) and **ShadowBan**.

In my free time, I enjoy doing research in **Forensics** (check out my Github).

Have a great time reading my articles ^^
